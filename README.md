I used many properties and learned a lot of things from this project:-

1. I used HTML, CSS, JS, and Local-Storage ( to store and get data) and creative tags in JavaScript.

2. I used a lot of CSS properties to improve the user interface of the website.

3. I worked on the Sign-in, Sign-up, and add-to-cart page and Payment page.

1. I worked on the product page and lab-test page. I face some problems in the JavaScript part but it gets resolved by discussing them with my friends.

2. I learn a lot of things in JavaScript, learn more about local storage, how to append, add the product to the cart, make sliding and drop-down pages, and also improved my HTML & CSS, I like working as a team, interact with each other professionally.

3. I gave my best and did a lot of things but still, there are a few functionally things that are left behind and remain static. In my point of view, we can make our website more efficient by using JavaScript from the initial days so that we can save time unlike making pages again and again by using CSS and HTML so that we could have been worked more on the remaining things.
